          ## Release Note

          Please refer to the commit messages for what's new in this release. We provide prebuilt binaries here for the x86-64 architecture as-is without any warranty. Follow the developer's guide on the project readme should you need to customize your build or for any other architecture.

          ### Deployment guide

          The prebuilt binaries are provided as-is. Download the binary file for your certain system, place it in a binary path with a short name.
          e.g.

          On Windows: C:\WINDOWS\system32\mccsx.exe
          On Linux/MacOS: /usr/bin/mccsx

          ### Prerequisite

          * .NET 5.0 SDK or runtime: Follow [the official guide](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) to install.
          * GDI+ lib: On platforms other than Windows, an additional lib must be installed to support the generation of heatmaps.

          For example, on Ubuntu, run
          ```
          sudo apt install libgdiplus
          ```
          On macOS, run
          ```
          brew install mono-libgdiplus
          ```
